            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
              Founded in 2020, Revive & Glow was born from a passion for skincare that truly works. Our founder, Emma Lawson, struggled with sensitive skin for years and was frustrated by products that promised results but delivered irritation.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              After years of research and collaboration with leading dermatologists, Emma created a line of skincare products focused on gentle yet effective ingredients that respect your skin's natural balance.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              Today, our mission remains the same: to create luxury skincare products that deliver visible results, restore confidence, and promote wellbeing â€“ all while respecting our planet.
